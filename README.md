# John-Mayer
Report produced as part of an evaluation criteria for the course 7230ICT Big Data Analytics and Social Media. 

Lecturer: Sebastian Binnewies

Grade: 10/10

We were required to think about a case study, in which we could apply social media analytics to gain insight about how a certain music artist or band could improve their popularity. Our group chose to analyse the singer John Mayer. 

We needed to describe the setting for our case study, apply social media analytics using the tools introduced during the labs, and evaluate our findings and determine appropriate future actions. We were required to use software for analysis and produce a written report explaining our analysis findings.
